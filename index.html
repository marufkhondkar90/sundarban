<p style="font-size:20px;background-color:silver;color:maroon;">Forest is the lung of the Mother Earth.
Without forest it’s impossible to live in the world.
That’s mean no forest no life.
The word “forest” comes from old French word forest (also fores).
And the Bans word derives from the English Word Forest.
The first known forests on Earth arose in the Late Devonian (approximately 380 million years ago), with the evolution of Archaeopteryx.
A mangrove is a shrub or small tree that grows in coastal saline or brackish water.
The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species.
Mangroves occur worldwide in the tropics and subtropics, mainly between latitudes 25° N and 25° S.
The total mangrove forest area of the world in 2000 was 137,800 square kilometers (53,200 sq mi), spanning 118 countries and territories.
Mangroves are salt-tolerant trees, also called halophytes, and are adapted to life in harsh coastal conditions.
They contain a complex salt filtration system and complex root system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action.
They are adapted to the low oxygen conditions of waterlogged mud.
Although mangroves inhabit only 0.7% of global coastal zone, but they have a significant contribution to the global carbon.
